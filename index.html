    <h2>[Rich]</h2>
    <p>Good afternoon my fellow wdd friends, my name is Richard and I go by either Richard or Rich. I live in south central Utah. I am in the software development BS degree path.</p>
    <p>I love doing many things outdoors, These include cycling, (all types), dirtbikes, skiing, and snowboarding. I am married and have 5 children, 4 girls and 1 boy. I currently teach a 7th and 8th grade blended class at a local public charter school.</p>
    <p>I am going to school to make a career change. I would like to be a softward developer. This course is a key introductory course where I can learn and become proficient in the foundation skills I will need to know to make a successful career. I have been an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all of my life. I served a mission to Columbus, Ohio It was great experience and faith builder.</p>
    <p>I am a self-proclaimed play baby. I love to have fun and just be out doing things. That's why I love the activities I do. I look forward to getting to know you all as we move through the weeks ahead.</p>
