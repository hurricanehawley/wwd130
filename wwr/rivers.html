                <p>I had the greatest time of my life with White Knuckle Rafting. They really went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. I even met the love of my life on this trip. Thank you again White Knuckle. If you have even a spark of an adventurous spirit and would like to try the sport of rafting, I would urge you to give this company a call. You will get the thrill of your life with them on these rivers.</p>

                <p>The slience of desolation is something that one cannot never fully appreciate until they have experienced it for themselves. White Knuckle Rafting's new location at the entrance of the Grand Canyon was a phenomenon experience not just in the thrill of the rapids, but just as much in the  peaceful solititude that is yours to enjoy every single day and night of your trip. Their original location in Colorado is incredible and this newest location does not disappoint.</p>

                <p>After the thrill of battling the rapids on thre four day guided expedition provided by White Knuckle Rafting, it was great to be able to relax in some of the most peaceful settings I can imagine. We would come across small coves and hideways not far from the river where streams would wind their way down to the Colorado. Some of these streams would cascade over cliff ledges into pools of crystal blue water. Some of these pools were so clear that it looked like you were looking through polished glass. I have never felt more at ease in my life those experiences, combined with the thrill of the river made my vacation one of the best experiences I've ever had.</p>
