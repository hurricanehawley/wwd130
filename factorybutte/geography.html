                <p>Three settlements were established along the banks of the Fremont River  named Caineville, Giles, and Hanksville. The Fremont River usually offered a limited supply of water to these settlements but there was enough water to plant crops close to the rivers course. The real struggle was when the river flooded causing great damage to fields. The town of Giles was impacted by events to such a degree that the town site was eventually abandoned leaving only Caineville and Hanksville still present to the present.</p>

                <p>The soil is not rich in nutrients and farming in the area is difficult. The Fremont River allowed water to settlers but the river is never consistent with its discharge and settlers often found themselves with very little of this precious resource, resulting in not only a threat to their livelihoods, but also their very lives.</p>

                <p>When unique locations are considered across the world, the work that the settlers of Caineville, Giles, and Hanksville had to do for their survival is commendable. From soil quality to the ruggedness of the landscape, there is very little about this landscape that invites habitation. Near the town of Hanksville, there is a Mars desert research station that is used to simulate what could be expected when mankind begins the process of working on and inhabiting another planet. Crew members apply and take a two week mission to this inhospitable landscape. The area invites a very close simulation to what would be found on another planet such as Mars. rugged mesas and buttes have made it the scene of a number of Hollywood movie productions such as the Disney film, “John Carter of Mars”.</p>
