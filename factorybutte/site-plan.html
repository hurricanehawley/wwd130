        The desert surrounding the small town of Caineville, Utah has become known world-wide as a destination for off-highway vehicle enthusiasts. This region of Utah has a very unique geology. The soil composition is made up of fine silts and mancos shale. This soil weathers very easily resulting in some of the most striking geographical features found anywhere in the world. The entire area is virtually vegetation free and this results in phenomenal open-area riding. The terrain offers a variety of different types of riding from relaxed and more tame trail rides to extreme free-style motocross style jumps. I promise that you will find everything you could possibly love about riding a motorcycle, ATV, or side by side style vehicles. Come to Factory Butte! You will not be disappointed that you did.

      <h3>The First Settlers</h3>
      <p>
        When members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, their leader, Brigham Young, began sending chosen members of the Church to establish settlements throughout the territory of Utah and beyond. One of the places that was chosen for the location of some of these settlements was in the desert now located east of Capitol Reef National Park and surrounding two large mesas and a large butte standing out stark in the emptiness which surrounded it. To the pioneer settlers who had been called by their prophet to settle this area, dis-heartened, and maybe even frightened are two words that come immediately to mind. The range of mountains to the south which eventually was given the name of the Henry mountain range, provided a colorful background to the gray nothingness. This is the scene that greeted these settlers from the eastern United States which is known to be so green and fertile. What a contrast their present setting must have appeared to them.
        One of the men chosen to lead this attempt to settle this no-man's-land was a powerful early leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His name was Ephraim Hanks. One of the settlements that would be established would be named in his honor. It is known as Hanksville. Ephraim Hanks had been involved in a pivotal event in early church history when he volunteered to rescue, in the harshest of winter conditions, members of a floundering hand-cart company of pioneers moving across the United States in an attempt to reach the Salt Lake Valley. They were caught in early winter storms and as a result, could continue no further. As winter bore down upon them, many began to lose their lives due to exposure to the elements and starvation. As he was traveling to rescue these pioneers, Ephraim came across a buffalo in circumstances that should never have happened. He was able to shoot this bison and bring it with him to the starving camp of pioneers. He would later account this experience as an answer to the prayers of those helpless souls. It was this kind of grit and determination that would help him and those he led to be successful in establishing these settlements. After his death, Ephraim Hanks was buried in the Caineville cemetery in humble grave when compared to the monumental life he lived.

      <h3>Geographical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Three settlements were established along the banks of the Fremont River which runs through this desert landscape named Caineville, Giles, and Hanksville. The Fremont River usually offered a limited supply of water to these settlements but there was enough water to plant crops close to the rivers course. The real struggle was when the river flooded causing great damage to fields. The town of Giles was impacted by events to such a degree that the town site was eventually abandoned leaving only Caineville and Hanksville still present to the present.
