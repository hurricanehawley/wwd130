                <p>When members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, their leader, Brigham Young, began sending chosen members of the Church to establish settlements throughout the territory of Utah and beyond. One of the places that was chosen for the location of some of these settlements was in the desert now located east of Capitol Reef National Park and surrounding two large mesas and a large butte standing out stark in the emptiness which surrounded it. To the pioneer settlers who had been called by their prophet to settle this area, dis-heartened, and maybe even frightened are two words that come immediately to mind.</p>

                <p>The range of mountains to the south, known as the Henry Mountain Range, provided a colorful background to the gray nothingness. This is the scene that greeted these settlers from the eastern United States which is known to be so green and fertile. What a contrast their present setting must have appeared to them. One of the men chosen to lead this attempt to settle this no-man's-land was a powerful early leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His name was Ephraim Hanks. One of the settlements that would be established would be named in his honor. It is known as Hanksville.</p>

                <p>Ephraim Hanks was already well-known among his fellow Latter_Day Saint pioneers. He had been directly involved in rescuing an emmigrant party traveling by means of a two-wheeled small cart known as a hand-cart. Members of this company were on the brink of starvation. A well-known part of Ephraim's rescue of these pioneers was him coming upon a lone bison, which was very uncommon. He was able to shoot the animal and bring it to the starving handcart pioneers. It is completely appropriate that he would be called upon to lead a group to settle such an unforgivng wilderness as the area surrounding Factory Butte and straddling the San Rafael swell is.</p>
